1. Machine Name: localhost or ubuntu@ec2-50-19-20-195.compute-1.amazonaws.com

2. Directory Path: absolute pathname /home/ubuntu/sample

3. Regarding code:

	i. Downloads/my-ec2-key.pem is the path to the key of the ec2 instance, so change accordingly.
       ii. BL is the folder on the remote machine which contains the code to run there.
      iii. arguments.txt contains the arguments being passed from the browser.
       iv. remote.js contains the code to schedule the backup.
        v. For every machine a folder is created on the S3 bucket 'Bausch&Lomb', like if backup is scheduled from localhost its Bausch&Lomb/localhost
       vi. Presently backup is incremental. If we want to schedule fullbackup after few days, it can be done easily.
      vii. Need the proper requirements to restore the files.
     viii. Using 'crontab' for scheduling the backup from the machine.
       ix. 'backupLog' contains the statistics of the backup scheduled.
	x. chmod 400 my-ec2-key.pem 
        
4. Rest I think it's self explanatory.

async module is not present in the node_modules. did "npm install async"

error says it is trying to find remote.js from the B-L directory as opposed to B-L/src. just made a copy of the 
remote.js into the B-l
